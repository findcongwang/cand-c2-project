I tried the accomdate the reduced budget by lowering the resource allocated to web and application servers.
Main changes were on EC2 instances, where all production and reserve instances were downgraded one tier, reduce storage from 100->30GB and now has a 3-year term.
Updated EC2 from a monthly storage of 100GB -> 30GB to bring cost just under reduced budget.
